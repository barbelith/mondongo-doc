MondongoSpeed
=============

The Mondongo documents are fast in themselves, but if we want to the reach the maximum performance that offers Mondongo, we'll have to use the documents *MondongoSpeed*.

The only thing that *MondongoSpeed* documents do is to avoid the constructor of PHP objects, but this simple detail considerably accelerates their creation.

To use *MondongoSpeed* the documents have to inherit from **MondongoDocumentSpeed** (the embeds of **MondongoDocumentEmbedSpeed**).

And to avoid the constructor, we have to do in the classes definition of documents the same that the constructor does: assign the default value of document data.

But as all in Mondongo, is very easy. We only have to specify the object fields with the default value, that is usually *null*. And if any of them is different from null, assign it *null* in the modifications to indicate Mondongo that it has changed.

    [php]
    class Article extends MondongoDocumentSpeed
    {
      static public function define($definition)
      {
        // default fields
        protected $data = array(
          'title'     => null,
          'content'   => null,
          'is_active' => true,
        );

        // modifications (only if it has default values different from null)
        protected $modified = array(
          'is_active' => null,
        );

        $definition->setFields(array(
          'title'     => 'string',
          'content'   => 'string',
          'is_active' => array('type' => 'boolean', 'default' => true),
        ));
      }
    }
